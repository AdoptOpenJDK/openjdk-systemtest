/**
 * ForkJoinPoolTestStress
 * ======================
 * 
 * Attempts to verify the correct function of the ForkJoinPool class in a simple test scenario. 
 * 
 * Split into two sections :
 * 
 * 		testAPI()		-	call as many of the API functions as possible using an instance of ForkJoinPool
 * 						-	API calls checked with assertions where possible
 * 						-   exercise the API using multiple threads and checking for correct concurrent behaviour
 * 						-	multiple threads are able to run testAPI concurrently
 * 
 * 		testStress()	-	differs from the testStress() methods seen in other concurrent tests
 * 						-	uses a single shared class instance of ForkJoinPool with a pool size of 10
 * 						-	submits tasks for execution into the pool
 * 						-	submits 20 ArraySummationTask and 20 ArrayMaximumTask tasks into the pool for execution
 * 						-	each instance of the test running simultaneously should introduce competition for the shared thread pool
 *
 * This test was written to test JSR166y.

	/*
	 * When creating an instance of ForkJoinPool the API creates worker threads for the pool and runs these as daemon threads.
	 * When a ForkJoinPool is shutdown, these threads do not automatically clean up - they remain until the VM shuts down. The typical
	 * usage scenario for ForkJoinPool as described in the API doc is that a single pool is created for the lifetime of the VM and that
	 * the same pool is reused again and again.
	 * 
	 * In the load tests as they were originally written, an instance of ForkJoinPool was created for each invocation of this testcase
	 * for use in the testAPI() method. This leads to a slow but definite leak of threads and hence a native OOM condition. To work around this,
	 * a single class instance is now instead used. Access to this instance is controlled by way of a ReentrantReadWriteLock effectively ensuring
	 * that only one instance of the test is making use of the apiPool at any given time. 
	 * 
	 * Unfortunately this restricts what can be tested e.g. ForkJoinPool.shutdown() cannot be run as this makes the pool unusable to future threads.
