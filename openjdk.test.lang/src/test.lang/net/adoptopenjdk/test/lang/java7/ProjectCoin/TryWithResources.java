 * 
 * TryWithResources
 * ================
 * 
 * New support for automatic resource management has been built into Java70. There is a new interface called 'AutoCloseable', 
 * and classes implementing this interface override the close() method, which contains everything needed to close a given resource.
 * As part of a try/catch, you can declare resources to be used within the try block that will be automatically closed on completion,
 * removing the need for resource.close() statements within the finally block.
 * 
 * In addition, exceptions are more sensibly handled. In pre-Java70, If we throw an exception V1 during the try block whilst working
 * with the stream, and a second exception V2 whilst closing the stream in the finally block, unless extra code is written to accommodate
 * this scenario, only exception V2 will be caught - which is actually the one you care least about.
 * 
 * If this happens in Java70, the exception V1 from the block is thrown, and V2 is added to V1's list of 'SuppressedExceptions'.
 * 
 * 1. Class FakeStream: Constructor FakeStream(boolean[] whereToFail)
 * 
 * 	- A dummy stream that provides open(), close() (for AutoClosing), and doStuff() methods to simulate a real stream, and
 * also throwInitException(), throwBlockException(), and throwClosingException(), which throw InitialisationExceptions, BlockExceptions,
 * and ClosingExceptions respectively.
 * 
 * - The constructor expects a 3-element boolean array. The booleans act as switches activating the throwing of an appropriate exception
 * during stream initialisation in open(), during doStuff() which should be called in the try block body, or during stream close in close().
 * 
 * 2. Scenarios Tested:
 * -  0: Exceptions activated in stream open(), in doStuff() body, and during stream close().
 * 	  -- Expected Behaviour: See an InitialisingException thrown from the open method. No further exceptions thrown or suppressed.
 *       Stream should be NULL after try/catch exits, as it never gets initialised.
 *       
 *    1: Exceptions activated in doStuff() body only.
 *    -- Expected Behaviour: A BlockException should be thrown from the body. No further exceptions should be thrown or suppressed.
 *    	 Stream should be CLOSED after try/catch exits, due to Auto closure.
 *    
 *    2: Exceptions activated in stream close() only.
 *    -- Expected Behaviour: A ClosingException should be thrown during automatic close(). No further exceptions should be thrown
 *    	 or suppressed.
 *    	 Stream should remain OPEN after try/catch exits, as Auto closure fails.
 *    
 *    3: Exceptions activated in both doStuff() body and stream close().
 *    -- Expected Behaviour: A BlockException and a ClosingException are both thrown during the try/catch. Using the new behaviour,
 *    	 the BlockException should be the one we catch, and the ClosingException should be first in it's list of SuppressedExceptions.
 *    	 Stream should remain OPEN after try/catch exits, as Auto closure fails.
